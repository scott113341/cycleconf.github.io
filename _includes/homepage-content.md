## Scale

Cycle.js is still in its infancy, our aim is to organize a small and focused conference. We are setting the initial limit at 50 participants. In case of insane demand we may consider moving to a bigger venue and making a bigger event.

## Accommodation

We are unable to provide hosting for participants. Copenhagen has many hotels, cosy Airbnb apartments, and friendly couch-surfing hosts.

## Speakers

We are still looking for speakers, if you are interested to speak during the conference please contact [aron@risedigital.dk](mailto:aron@risedigital.dk) to introduce yourself and detail the topic of your presentations.
